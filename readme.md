### Typography: 
Defines clear and readable typography for headers, paragraphs, and links. Uses responsive font sizes to enhance legibility on different devices.

### Color Scheme: 
Utilizes a cohesive color scheme with a background color of #E8CBAE for headers and footers. The modal adopts a darker background (#212529) for improved contrast.

### Flexbox Layout: 
Leverages flexbox to structure the hero section, blog container, and bio section. The layout dynamically adapts to different screen sizes.
